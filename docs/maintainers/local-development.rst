Local Development
=================

TODO: Update! (Use ../doc/HACKING.md as reference)

This page documents day-to-day local workflows for maintainers.
Repository-level and external service setup remains in
:doc:`/maintainers/repository-setup`.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A Python version within the current support window (last three Python versions)
- Poetry package manager

Install dependencies
--------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry install --no-interaction --with docs

Run tests
---------

Run the test suite and dependency compatibility matrix with nox:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run nox

Run the full suite without matrix testing:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run python src/manage.py test

Run a specific test module:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run python src/manage.py test tests.test_serializer

Run a single test case:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run python src/manage.py test tests.test_serializer.YourTestCase

Run test coverage
-----------------

Coverage is configured in ``pyproject.toml`` and enforced with a
``fail_under`` threshold of **90%**.

Run coverage from the repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=src
    poetry run coverage run --rcfile=pyproject.toml src/manage.py test tests
    poetry run coverage report --rcfile=pyproject.toml -m

If coverage fails, review the ``Missing`` column and add tests for the
reported lines or branches before opening a PR.

Build documentation
-------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry run sphinx-build -W -T -v docs/ site/

What these options do:

- ``-W``: Treat warnings as errors (to catch broken references)
- ``-T``: Print tracebacks
- ``-v``: Verbose output (-v -v even more verbose)

Deliberately not included is ``--keep-going``, because it may swallow errors.

Common maintenance commands
---------------------------

- Show dependency graph: ``poetry show --tree``
- Update lock file after dependency changes: ``poetry lock``
- Bump package version: ``poetry version patch`` (or ``minor`` / ``major``)

Daily checklist
---------------

1. Pull latest ``main``.
2. Run tests.
3. Run coverage and confirm it stays at or above 90%.
4. Run docs build if public behavior or docs changed.
5. Keep changelog updates in :doc:`/reference/changelog` for user-visible
   changes.
