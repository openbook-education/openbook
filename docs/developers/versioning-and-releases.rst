=======================
Versioning and Releases
=======================

This page documents the versioning strategy and the steps required to cut a
release of ``openbook``.

-------------------
Versioning Strategy
-------------------

``openbook`` follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_
(SemVer). Given a version number ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``:

- **PATCH** is incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- **MINOR** is incremented for backwards-compatible new features.
- **MAJOR** is incremented for breaking changes to the public API.

There are currently no plans to introduce breaking changes. Users can safely
update to any patch or minor release without modifying their code.

.. -------------
.. Release model
.. -------------
..
.. OpenBook releases are created from signed tags and published as GitHub Releases
.. with source archives and SBOM artifacts. The release workflow does not publish
.. Python packages to PyPI.
..
..
.. ---------------------------------
.. Release Tag Signature Enforcement
.. ---------------------------------
..
.. The release workflow enforces signed, annotated tags before any artifacts are
.. built or published.
..
.. - Tags must be created with ``git tag -s`` (annotated + signed).
.. - Lightweight tags are rejected.
.. - Tags with missing or invalid signatures are rejected.
..
.. This check is performed in ``.github/workflows/release.yml`` via the GitHub API
.. verification metadata for the tag object.
..
.. Signed commits are also recommended for maintainers, but they are not enforced
.. by the release workflow.


-----------------
Release Checklist
-----------------

1. **Ensure main is green.**

   All CI checks must pass before tagging.

2. **Create release issue (recommended).**

   Create a new issue for the release and describe remaining work to be done before
   a new version is released. You don't need to repeat the individual release steps.
   Just, what else needs to be done.

3. **Create new branch.**

   From within the release issue create a new release preparation branch. Checkout
   the branch as the next steps must all be performed within that branch.

4. **Complete remaining work.**

   If there is any remaining work to be done (e.g. updating documentation) push the
   changes onto the release preparation branch.

5. **Update the changelog.**

   Add a dated entry to :doc:`/administrators/changelog` summarising user-visible changes.
   See :ref:`changelog-format` below for the expected format.

6. **Bump the version number** in ``pyproject.toml`` using Poetry:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # choose one of: patch, minor, major
      poetry version minor

7. **Commit the version bump:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add pyproject.toml docs/administrators/changelog.rst
      git commit -m "Bump version: vX.Y.Z"

8. **Open and merge pull request.**

   Now open a pull request to merge the release preparation branch into main. At this
   stage Copilot will review the branch, code quality and security will be scanned,
   documentation will be built, and unit tests will run. Usually you will need to
   push a few more commits to the release branch (which will automatically appear in
   the PR and retrigger quality checks).

   Once all is green, merge the pull request into main.

9. **Tag the commit in order to trigger the release workflow.**

   Checkout the main branch and create a **signed annotated tag** for the merge
   commit, then push the tag to GitHub:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout main
      git pull
      git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
      git push origin --tags

   The ``.github/workflows/release.yml`` workflow will automatically:

   - Verify the tag is a signed annotated tag with a valid signature
   - Verify the tag version matches ``pyproject.toml``
   - Run the full test suite and build the documentation again (for safety)
   - Build a versioned source archive artifact (``.tar.gz``)
   - Generate a CycloneDX SBOM (``sbom.cyclonedx.json``)
   - Create a GitHub release with release notes extracted from the changelog

   Monitor the workflow run in the **Actions** tab.

.. _changelog-format:


----------------
Changelog Format
----------------

The changelog is located in ``docs/administrators/changelog.rst`` and uses
reStructuredText (RST) formatting. Each version entry must follow this structure,
allowing the release workflow to extract the changelog entries for the GitHub
release page.

.. code-block:: rst

   X.Y.Z (Month Year)
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - Change 1
   - Change 2
   - Change 3

Guidelines
..........

- Use the exact version number (e.g., ``2.1.0``) without the ``v`` prefix.
- Add the release date in parentheses (e.g., ``(April 2026)``).
- Add underline using ``^`` characters of same length.
- List changes as bullet points with clear, user-facing descriptions.
- Start descriptions with the affected component.
- Group related changes together logically.

Pre-releases
............

For pre-release versions (alpha, beta, release candidate), use the extended
version format in the tag and changelog:

.. code-block:: bash

   git tag v2.1.0-pre1
   git tag v2.1.0-rc1

Update the changelog accordingly:

.. code-block:: rst

   0.0.1-pre1 (April 2026)
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - Preview of upcoming features...

The release workflow will automatically detect pre-releases and mark them as
such in GitHub.


-----------
Tag Signing
-----------

Setup
.....

Release tags must be signed. If tag signing is not configured locally, set it
up once before creating your next release:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Use your existing GPG key ID
   git config --global user.signingkey <YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID>
   git config --global tag.gpgSign true

To list available secret keys and find your key ID:

.. code-block:: bash

   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

Only signed annotated tags (``git tag -s``) are accepted by the release
workflow.

Signing commits is also recommended as a general repository security practice,
but commit signing is currently not enforced by the release workflow.

Troubleshooting
...............

If the release workflow rejects a signed tag with a reason such as ``bad_email``,
inspect the tag metadata first:

.. code-block:: bash

   git cat-file -p <tag>

Look for the ``tagger`` line, for example:

.. code-block:: text

   tagger Name <email@example.com> ...

When you create a signed tag with ``git tag -s``, Git embeds the tagger identity
from your local Git configuration. That email address must:

- Be present in your GitHub account
- Be verified in GitHub
- Match exactly, including casing

A common failure mode is that GitHub has multiple verified email addresses, but
Git is using the wrong one via ``user.email``. This matters because Git uses
that email for the tagger identity, while GPG signs with a key that is usually
associated with specific UID email addresses. If the tagger email and the
verified GitHub identity do not align, GitHub tag verification can fail.

To fix this, delete the incorrect tag locally and remotely, correct your Git
identity, then recreate and push the signed tag:

.. code-block:: bash

   git tag -d <tag>
   git push origin :refs/tags/<tag>

   git config user.email <correct-verified-email>
   git tag -s <tag>
   git push origin <tag>


-------------
Read the Docs
-------------

Documentation is rebuilt automatically on every push to ``main`` and on every
tag that matches the ``v*`` pattern. No manual trigger is needed after pushing
a release tag. See :doc:`/developers/repository-setup` for details of the Read
the Docs project settings and automation rules.
